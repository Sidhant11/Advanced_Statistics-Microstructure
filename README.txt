Pair distribution function gives the relative probability of finding a particle of given size at distance r and angle theta, to a reference particle. This code generates the pair distribution statistics for small particles distributed around other small particles (in a bidisperse system). It reads from the T.txt file which is the configuration file of particle positions. Inputs for statistical sampling are described in comments of the code.
